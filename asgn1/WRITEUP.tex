This is fig2.pdf which shows all the random points ploted on a gragh points inside the circle are blue points outside are red.

\section{Unix Comands that were Used}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{bash}: wrote a script in bash as directed
  \begin{itemize}
     \item file redirection: to store intermidiate data
     \item variables: to hold paramater values
     \item if and test comands: to check if argument was passed
     \item heredoc: used to write gnuplot script in file
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{grep}: used -v to filter out the head row and -E with regular expression to filter in and out of circle data
  \item \textbf{awk}: selects appropriate columns to use for data and caluclate the difference between the estimate of pi and set value for pi
  \item \textbf{gnuplot}: can graph and create plots as needed for fig2.pdf and fig3.pdf
\end{itemize}
