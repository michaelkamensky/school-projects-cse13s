\section{What I learned}
For this assignment I learned how to work with matrices in C.
I learned that a matrix in C is a pointer of an array which points to more arrays. The first array represent the rows and the second arrays represent the cols.
Additionally, I learned how to clear the array by first clearing the cols arrays and then clear the row array of pointers to make sure that there are no memoryleaks.
I learned how to work with fscanf and how you can use format string to read the values from files that you need for your project.
I worked with fopen and fclose and other file commands and learned how they work, learned that I need to close files.
I learned how to write into files for output.
I found out that gcc compiler in some cases finds errors that clang doesn't. Maybe it is a good idea to use comiplers to catch maximum number of errors.
In c I learned that in some programs you can work with structures without its definition. As long as a pointer to the structure is used and accessor functions are used.
Learned new case with getopt on how to take strings as an argument.:
Finally I learned how to work with the ncurses libary and was able to create a display for the game of life.
