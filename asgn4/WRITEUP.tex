\section{What I learned}
For this assignment I learned how to work with matrices in C.
I learned that a matrix in C is a pointer of an array which points to more arrays. The first array represent the rows and the second arrays represent the cols.
Additionally I learned how to clear the array by first clearing the cols arrays and then clear the row array of pointers to make sure that there are no memoryleaks.
I learned how to work with fscanf and how you can use regular expressions to read the values you need for your project.
I worked with fopen and fclose and other file commands and learned how they work.
Finally I learned how to write into files for output.
