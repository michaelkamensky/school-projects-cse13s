\section{What I learned}
For this assignment I learned:
\begin{itemize}
\item How to use the Lempel-Ziv Compression algorithm and how we use a dictionary to record repeating patterns and therefore are able to use a code to reference those patterns and greatly reduce the number of bytes needed to write them out
\item In LZ78 learned how to avoid writing code dictionary into compressed file; instead, we generate the dictionary on the fly when decompressing
\item How to read and write a certain number of bytes using a repeated call to read() and write()
\item How to do the buffered I/O by having a buffer in memory and then writing them only when needed
\item How to write bits into a file using a buffer and then once the buffer is full write it out to a file
\item How to use tries, create, navigate, and delete them to create a fast look-up dictionary for my compression 
\item How to use fstat to get file attributes including permissions and size
\item How to get the bit length of an integer without using the log function
\item There are little and big endian CPUs where that have different byte orders and looking through given functions learned to test endianness and how to byte swap
\end{itemize}
