\section{Running mathlib-test}
Here is an example of runnig my tests:

\begin{verbatim} 
mkamensk@vera:~/cse13s/asgn2$ ./mathlib-test -a -s
e() = 2.718281828459046, M_E = 2.718281828459045, diff = 0.000000000000000
e term = 17
pi_bbp() = 3.141592653589793, M_PI = 3.141592653589793, diff = 0.000000000000000
pi_bbp() term = 11
pi_viete() = 3.141592653589793, M_PI = 3.141592653589793, diff = -0.000000000000000
pi_viete() factors = 25
pi_euler() = 3.141592558095903, M_PI = 3.141592653589793, diff = -0.000000095493891
pi_euler() terms = 10000000
pi_madhava() = 3.141592653589800, M_PI = 3.141592653589793, diff = 0.000000000000007
pi_madhava() terms = 27
sqrt_newton() = 1.414213562373095, M_SQRT2 = 1.414213562373095, diff = -0.000000000000000
sqrt_newton() iteration = 6

\section{Calculation of PI}
These three methods converge really quickly to desired value

But Euler Pi calculation converges really slowely

\section{Calculation of Square Root of Two}

\section{Analysis}
Calculation of pi, BBP algorithm seems the best since it converges after 11 terms.
Madhava and Vietes' algorithms number of terms were pretty much the same. However, the number of terms does not mean time effcient, becasue of different term calculation cost.
Eulers method was not only the slowest but was the least accurate.
If one wants a better approximation for either pi, e, or sqrt you can lower the value of Epsilon so that the algorithms run more iterations.
