# Pi and E Project (Assignment 2)

## Description
This is a project that uses multiple c functions that find the approximation of either pi or e constants using different kinds of series, algorithms and formulas. The series include Jacob Bernoulli taylor seires for E, The Madhava series for pi, Euler’s series for pi, the Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe formula for pi, Viète’s formula of an infinite product for pi. Addtionally, an algoirthm for approximating the square root of an object. Afterwards a program called mathlib-test.o compares the values generated by these algorithms and compares it to the values in the math.h library 

This is a response to [assignment2](https://git.ucsc.edu/cse13s/winter2023-section01/resources/-/blob/main/asgn2/asgn2.pdf) in [Cse13s course](https://git.ucsc.edu/cse13s/winter2023-section01/resources) 

## Installation
First you need to compile all appropirate c files to create mathlib-test: run make as follows
```
make clean && make
```

## Usage
To run this program with all tests run mathlib-test as follows
```
./mathlib-test -a -s
```
You can use indvidual tests using additional options. 
The opitions can be seen with -h command:
```
SYNOPSIS
   Prints approximations for pi and e and compares it to libary values.

USAGE
   ./mathlib-test [options]

OPTIONS
    -h display program help and usage.
    -e runs Eulers apprximation of e
    -b runs Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe apprximation of pi
    -v runs Vietes apprximation of pi
    -m runs Madhava apprximation of pi
    -s sets stats mode shows the number iterations for each approximation
    -n Runs Newton-Raphson square root approximation test
    -a runs all tests
```
To generate the graph data and pdf files run plot.sh:
```
./plot.sh
```

## Support
Please contact mkamensk@ucsc.edu if you need help or provide feedback for this project

## Roadmap
It would be nice to add a command line option to trace the algorithm convergence, as it would be required to plot graphs.
